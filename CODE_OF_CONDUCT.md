# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Positive behavior includes:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness
- Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They may remove, edit, or reject contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces and when representing the community publicly.

Report unacceptable behavior by [opening an issue](https://github.com/kokistudios/athanor/issues/new). All complaints will be reviewed promptly and fairly. Community leaders will respect the privacy of reporters.
